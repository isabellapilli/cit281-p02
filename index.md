## PROJECT 2

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience using git via your CLI and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Source Control
2. Gain experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code
3. Practice refactoring JavaScript code

Overview: 

1. Use the command line interface (CLI) of your operating system to create and work with a git repository (repo)
2. Refactor the JavaScript program from the previous project to practice using git and practice refactoring
3. Use git via VSCode
  a. Create and use a .gitignore file
  b. Diff split screen
```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project I was able to create a few different functions. The first *function getRandomLetter()* returned a single, random, lowercase letter, the second *function getRandomString(minLength, maxLength)* returned a random length string, and the last *function getSortedString(string)* returned a string in ascending order. I was also able to experiment with function expressions and anonymous functions, and learn more about staging files as well.
